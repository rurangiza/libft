# Curriculum
## Programming Foundations
The curriculum at 42 schools consists of a list of projects we need to complete before a certain deadline. 
Everytime we complete a project, our deadline is pushed furher, but if we reach that deadline, we are dropped out of the school.
In the first year at 42, we learn foundation concepts in programming and how to code in C.

The subjects covered by our projects range from:
- Unix C
- Algorithms
- Networks
- System administration
- Graphics programming
- Object oriented programming
