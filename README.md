## A library of basic functions in C

This project consists of re-writing built-in functions in C from scratch using our own logic.

The goal being to understand how they work exactly, what clever tricks were used to implement them, and recognize their strengths/limitations so we can use them in a more deliberate way.

In this project, I learned how to:
- Implement functions for tasks like string handling (identify characters type / copy, concatenate, trim, split, search / convert to a string to a number,...) 
- Create a custom library
- Write a Makefile 

## Table of content
| Function name | Description |
|---|---|
| isalpha  | The isalpha() function checks whether a character is an alphabet or not.  |
|  isdigit | The isdigit() function checks whether a character is numeric character (0-9) or not.  |
